# A series of Web Scrapers

### Using BS4 (Beautiful Soup) to scrape a HTML page

### Using Selenium to scrape my JavaScript Portfolio page

In both cases I used the scraped data to generate my Skills Wordcloud for my GitHub portfolio and for the footer image on my portfolio website, hosted by GitHub pages [here](https://annwyl21.github.io/)

- my email
- my portfolio URL
